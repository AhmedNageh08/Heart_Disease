# Heart_Disease

### Data:
It contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4<br />

### Attributes:
-age<br />
-sex<br />
-chest pain type (4 values)<br />
-resting blood pressure<br />
-serum cholestoral in mg/dl<br />
-fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl<br />
-resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)<br />
-maximum heart rate achieved<br />
-exercise induced angina<br />
-oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest<br />
-the slope of the peak exercise ST segment<br />
-number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy<br />
-thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect<br />

### What i did ?
We have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. In addition, we will analyze for this dataset. We will use a wide range of tools for this part. If there's value in there, we'il do it there. Finally, machine learning algorithms are estimated.
